## Capacitor size support  
### Choose a cover based on what size capacitor you have
- Cover - Default
  - Up to 12mm diameter
- Cover - Extra Clearance
  - Up to 18mm diameter

## Printing

**Recommend using preconfigured 3mf file - [OSSM - Body - 2.x AIO.3mf](OSSM%20-%20Body%20-%202.x%20AIO.3mf)**

    0.2mm layer height
    Standard strength (5 wall) profile
    15% gyroid or crosshatch infill
    Tree/organic Supports ~4deg overhang setting
  
Supports required for:
  - OSSM - Body - 2.x AIO - Cover (any)
  - OSSM - Body - 2.x AIO - Middle

I recommend using a raft on "OSSM - Body - 2.x AIO - Cover", this will help with support removal as well.

It's a lot of support, but it's a small part.  
Possibly can optimize some of this out in a future rev.
