These allow for easy one-hand adjusting of the hinges via quick release lever, rather than having to hold onto the nut while loosening/tightening. Also increases the surface area for contact which will help hold everything in place

Made for M8 nut/bolt and quick releases. On the quick release side, place a 15mm washer down before inserting the quick release lever


Print face-down, use supports from build plate

Important:
This model uses a 'hack' where I sliced a .05mm wall down the sides of the positioning key which will trick the slicer into generating walls deep within the part leading up to the key - vital for shear strength.
For printing, make sure you enable "Print Thin Walls" (Cura) (or set "Slice gap closing radius" to 0.0025 if in another slicer) in your slicer to take advantage of this.
