### **Hinge 40-4040CL**  
Replaces default Shick's hinge with an experimental hinge with 3.2mm thickness to support 1/8" metal hinges

Prints standing tall at a slight angle, no supports.  
This angle is intended to provide higher strength where stresses are involved on this hinge.

### **Hinge Plate Knob M8 For Metal**  
Made for M8 nut.

Print nut face down, supports optional when printing at .2 layer height

**Important:**  
This model uses a 'hack' where I sliced a .05mm wall down the sides of the positioning key which will trick the slicer into generating walls deep within the part leading up to the key - vital for shear strength.  
For printing, make sure you enable "Print Thin Walls" (Cura) (or set "Slice gap closing radius" to 0.0025 if in another slicer) in your slicer to take advantage of this.
