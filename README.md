# OSSM-Parts

Contains parts I've designed/remixed for improving the OSSM experience.  

    //TODO: make the readme look nicer.
    //TODO: Add licensing information.
    //      This will vary by part in this repo, the majority being "MIT License" for full open source
    //      There will be an occasional "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0" non-commercial license for parts that have 
    //        taken me considerable time to develop
    //      Unless a license is present, assume "MIT License"
