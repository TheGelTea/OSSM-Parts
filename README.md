## Licensing
This will vary by part in this repo, the majority being "MIT License" for full open source.  
There will be an occasional "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0" non-commercial for parts that have taken me considerable time to develop.  
If LICENSE.md is not present - assume "MIT License (c) Kinky Makers 2020".
