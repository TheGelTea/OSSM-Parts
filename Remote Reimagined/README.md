# OSSM Remote Reimagined
![](Images/Renders/Remote%20Only.png)
## Summary    
Reimagines the OSSM Remote in single-handed form factor allowing control of Speed and Depth knobs (and click) with just one thumb.  
To be used in the right hand.

"Fail-safe" by still allowing traditional use of both knobs.

### Bill Of Materials
    2x M4-10mm
    ~80mm x ~4mm rubber band

### Notes:
 - I found that putting a single twist in the rubberband substantially improves grip between the knobs.
 - There is room for improvement in filament usage and ergonomics for the Bottom, feel free to contribute designs!

### Updates:
  - 09.07.2024 - v1 released
