# 24mm Nut - Hex Flower - Single/Double Threaded
![](Images/Renders/Overview.png)

## Summary
* Tapered thread entry for easier initial threading
* 40mm outer diameter with smooth "flower petal" edges
  * Petal shape design causes wall overlap when printing with 5+ walls, 0.4 nozzle, increasing part strength
  * Petal shape gives finger grip points and allows for (future) wrench use
* Double-threaded version has 180 degree offset thread for easier initial threading (Doubles the chance of threads catching)
